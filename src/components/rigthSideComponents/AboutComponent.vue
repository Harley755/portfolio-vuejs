      <p class="mb-4">
        I'm an adaptable, detail-oriented software developer focused on building scalable, high-performance software
        solutions that significantly improve user experiences. With a deep interest in development, I specialize in
        working with technologies such as
        <span class="font-medium text-slate-200 hover:text-teal-300 focus-visible:text-teal-300">
          Laravel, TypeScript, VueJS, PostgreSQL</span> and <span
          class="font-medium text-slate-200 hover:text-teal-300 focus-visible:text-teal-300">Flutter</span>. I strive to
        develop functional systems that
        improve
        quality of life through efficient and innovative code.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        I am also actively learning <span
          class="font-medium text-slate-200 hover:text-teal-300 focus-visible:text-teal-300">NestJS</span>, which has
        given me a deeper understanding of TypeScript-based backend
        development and how to build scalable, maintainable APIs with a modular architecture. This framework complements
        my existing knowledge and is helping me improve the quality and efficiency of my backend solutions. </p>

      <p class="mb-4">My professional experience also includes proficiency in
        <span class="font-medium text-slate-200 hover:text-teal-300 focus-visible:text-teal-300">Github</span>, with a
        strong focus on efficient and collaborative development.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        In my spare time, I enjoy listening to music, reading, and exploring new ways to optimize my development
        process. I am deeply committed to continuous learning, always striving to deepen my understanding of the
        technologies I use to deliver innovative solutions that meet both client and user needs.
