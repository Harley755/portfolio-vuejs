          An adaptable, detail-oriented software developer, I'm deeply

          In my spare time, I like to listen to music, watch videos on YouTube
          and, when I'm not in front of a screen, I like to play basketball or
          ride my bike. I am continuously learning and striving to understand in
          depth the tools and technologies I use, ensuring that I can deliver
          high-quality, innovative solutions.
